### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
First, we analysed outcomes for theater by launch date. Our dataset was not in a consumable format. So we used a pivot table to re-format it, then we could make a plot out of it.<br>
For our second analysis, we were missing data for the canceled outcome.

## Results

- First of all, we can see that a campaign have a lot more chance to be successful if started late spring or early summer.<br>
In a second hand, winter isn't the good time of of year to start a crowdfundraising.
 

- We can analyse that the less money you raise(<15K$), the higher probability your campaign will be successful but there is an outlier between 35K$ and 45K$.

- We are lacking data for goals amounts passed 15K$, that means the analysis is not statistically significant.<br>Also we do not have any data to analyse for canceled outcomes. 

- We can perform an analysis based on the ended date of a campaign or looking at the country they take place in.<br>
Like that Louise can figure out the optimal time frame of her campaign and in which country she will have the highest probability to succeed.
